#  InboxSage AI - Email Auto-Responder & Spam Filter

InboxSage AI is a Python-based email support automation tool that reads unread Gmail messages, filters spam, classifies legitimate emails, and sends intelligent replies — all automatically. It's built with customer support in mind, reducing manual workload while maintaining professionalism.


##  Features

-  Automatically fetches unread emails
-  Filters spam using rules + AI (Cohere LLM)
-  Classifies messages into:
  - Complaint
  - Feedback
  - Product/Service Question
  - Other
-  Generates polite, context-aware replies
-  Logs every response with category & timestamp
-  Skips replies if already responded twice



##  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Gmail API**
- **Cohere AI (LLM for text classification & reply generation)**
- `.env` for secure API keys
- Google OAuth2 (`credentials.json` + `token.pickle`)

##  Notes

* Automatically avoids replying more than twice to the same thread.
* Spam detection uses both simple keyword rules and LLM-based reasoning.
* Logs are saved in `sent_emails_log.csv`.
